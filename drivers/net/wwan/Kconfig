	  Say Y here if you want to use the WWAN driver core. This driver
	  provides a common framework for WWAN drivers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be

          Enables debugfs infrastructure for the WWAN core and device drivers.

          If this option is selected, then you can find the debug interface
          elements for each WWAN device in a directory that is corresponding to
          the device name: debugfs/wwan/wwanX.

          MHI WWAN MBIM is a WWAN network driver for QCOM-based PCIe modems.
          It implements MBIM over MHI, for IP data aggregation and muxing.
          A default wwan0 network interface is created for MBIM data session
          ID 0. Additional links can be created via wwan rtnetlink type.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
          called mhi_wwan_mbim.

	help
	  MHI WWAN CTRL allows QCOM-based PCIe modems to expose different modem
	  control protocols/ports to userspace, including AT, MBIM, QMI, DIAG
	  and FIREHOSE. These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace
	  (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libmbim, libqmi,
	  libqcdm...).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mhi_wwan_ctrl.

config MHI_WWAN_DTR
	tristate "MHI WWAN DTR driver for QCOM-based PCIe modems"

	help
	  MHI WWAN DTR allows QCOM-based PCIe modems to expose UART signals.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mhi_wwan_ctrl.
